<p><b style="font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; text-align: inherit; background-color: initial;">Information technology</b> (<b style="font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; text-align: inherit; background-color: initial;">IT</b>) is the application of computers and telecommunications equipment to store, retrieve, transmit and manipulate data, often in the context of a business or other enterprise. IT is considered a subset of information and communications technology (ICT). In 2012, Zuppo proposed an ICT hierarchy where each hierarchy level "contain some degree of commonality in that they are related to technologies that facilitate the transfer of information and various types of electronically mediated communications.". Business/IT was one level of the ICT hierarchy.</p>
